Analyze pharmaceutical testing data, plot and summarize findings

## Background

Pymaceuticals Inc. is screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.
In its latest study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

## Data Description
 - 9 treament drugs and 1 placebo were test in 249 mice over 45 days.
 - One mouse was removed from the data due to duplicate measurements.
 - In the final data set of 248 mice, the ratio of male to female mice was nearly even at 50.4% vs 49.6%, respectively.
 - The final number of observations in the study totaled 1,880 and the observations per drug ranged from 148 to 230, indicating robust sample sizes for each drug tested.
 - The starting measurement for each tumor was ~45 mm3 across all tested treatments.

## Approach

 - Read in two csv files and merged into one dataframe
 - Called pandas functions to perform various calculations using groupby including: mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of tumor volume by drug regimen.
 - Generated bar charts showing the total number of measurements for all mice tested by drug regimen using Pandas method and pyplot method.
 - Generated pie charts showing the distribution of female versus male mice in the study using Pandas method and pyplot method.
 - Calculated the final tumor volume of each mouse across the four top drugs of interest: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin.
 - Calculated the quartiles, inter-quartile range (IQR) and determined potential outliers using upper and lower bounds method of the top four drugs.
 - Generated a box plot showing the distribution of the final tumor size for each mouse tested across the top four drugs.
 - Created a line plot and a scatter plot for a select mouse treated with Capomulin depicting the tumor volume over time for the mouse.
 - For the Capomulin treatment the following were calculated:
      - The Pearson correlation coefficient between mouse weight and average tumor volume
      - The linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume
      - Plot of the linear regression model on top of a scatter plot
